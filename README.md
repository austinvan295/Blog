Creating this Blog taught me a lot of things like HTML, Templates, CSS, and other great things, I truly believe that I will never stop learning computer science and that there are tons of things that I have yet to discover and I look forward to it! I love challenges even though it takes me hours or even days to finish one. The moment when you find the solution, it is one of the best feelings in the world.
