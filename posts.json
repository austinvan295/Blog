    "title": "About Me",
    "content": "My names Austin and I am currently 21 years old. I was born and raised in Montgomery, Texas and lived there for about 11 years before moving to Conroe which is about
                15 min away from Montgomery. I attended Conroe High School in 2013 and graduated in 2017. I decided while in College that I would take a couple of gap years because I
                felt like I was not ready for school yet and decided to work in different industries such as Food and Dry Cleaning. In 2019 I decided to return to school again and
                have commited full-time ever since. I chose Computer Science because I remembered when I was 15 years old I created a gaming server and worked with things such as 
                Java, CSS, HTML, MySQL, Databases, and ETC. I can rememeber all the early mornings and sleepless nights dealing with a lot of isues, but the best feeling was when
                I finally found a solution to the problem. I think its one of the best feelings in the world and thats why I decided to choose Computer Science. ",
